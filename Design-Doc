How will the game work?
    The game will take place in a 2D array
    The array will be of objects "Chess_Pieces"
    The array will go from A1 to H8 as follows t = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], etc]
    The pieces will either be filled with objects, or null.
    
Rules for moving pieces   
    a piece will be selected
    The available spots to move the piece will be highlighted
    If one of those spots are selected, the piece will move there.
        a piece will be moved into a spot before it is deleted
        a piece will check if the spot is available before moving
        if there is an oponent piece, it will take it
